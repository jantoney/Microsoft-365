# This script is designed to import a CSV file and
#  - Add the required Phone System License to the user
#  - Enterprise Voice Enable users
#  - Assign a calling policy to users
#  - Assign a DID phone number to uses (based on the CSV script)
#
# CSV FILE
# Requires a file with headders
# - UserPrincipalName
# - DID
#
# REQUIREMENTS
# The following powershell modules are required and will be checked and installed on script run
# - Skype for Business Online
# - Azure AD
# - Voice callign policy named 'Australia'.
#
# File released under GPL v3.0. Please leave this comment in-tack when re-distributing
# Written by Jay Antoney
#
# Further Notes
# There is a lot wrong with this script because it was written quickly, but it works.
# I'll update and change it over time, please feel free to make comments or do a pull request as required.
# Instead of copying this and redistributing, let's keep the script here, update it and link back to it. Single source of truth :)
# ** The script has been written for AUSTRALIAN users only, I'll update the script at some point - or you can help ;) **
#
# TO-DO
# - Check if the first CHAR is a + symbol in the CSV file and remove it
# - Check the 2nd & 3rd CHAR are 61
# - Check the 4th is a valid area code number (2, 3, 8 & 7)
# - Change the script to allow any County and Calling Policy Name
